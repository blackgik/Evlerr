Description

Not an expensive two-bedroom apartment in a minute walk from the beach.
A two-room apartment with a sea view will certainly interest you. First of all, these apartments are located in a very convenient location. It looks close to the road, but also in a very quiet place. Just a few steps from the shared luxury beach. But it is also very close to Girne American University. What makes this apartment attractive for investment? In addition, students are constantly looking for the most rental housing in the area. It is worth noting that it is not only 2 steps, but also very close to the road where the shuttle buses run:
Chemist
Cinema
Supermarket
Construction Markets
hairdressers
a cafe
Restaurants with local cuisine
Bank
And all the necessary infrastructure for life
Explanation
The apartment is located on the 2nd floor of a two-storey building. Between the house and the sea is a green area which makes the view from the French balcony perfect. In the complex there are several identical two-story houses, in which most of the apartments are bought by Russian-speaking people. Besides meeting new people, you can always ask your neighbors to help you settle in. Of course, they will be happy to assist you with the translation of the language in the shop or in other situations. Also, there will always be someone to drink tea with, not just to fry a kebab or go to a restaurant.
In addition to permanent rental income, the apartments will give you a comfortable holiday in your own flat in Cyprus. In conclusion, we recommend that you consider these apartments as your own corner in Cyprus.

Iskele
Iskele is synonymous with great relaxation and beautiful sea sunsets! The Cypriots themselves jokingly call the city the future of Miami. However, there is some truth in this. Literally, 10 years ago there was nothing here but a small village. And now, of course, this is a new modern area, which is being actively built up with resort-type complexes.
Key facts about Iskele:
Famagusta – 24.5 km.
Ercan airport – 64.9 km.
Larnaca Airport – 89.5 km.
Iskele’s coastline stretches for 25 km. Here is the Long Beach coastline with some of the most beautiful beaches on the island. Undoubtedly, a gentle entrance to the sea, golden sand, developed service and entertainment infrastructure – what else is needed for a good rest and life ?!
However, the outskirts of the city are also famous for a large number of attractions. For example, here is the ancient city of Salamis, which was once the largest among all Hellenic cities.

Kyrenia
Kyrenia or Girne (tour. Girne) is a city in Northern Cyprus. After the Turkish aggression in 1974, it is located on the territory of the unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. It is now considered the tourist center of Northern Cyprus. Located on the northern coast of the island, at the foot of the Kyrenia Mountains. In addition, there are two versions of the origin of the name of the city: by the name of Aphrodite – “Cyreniana”, or from the name of one of the Greek mountains.
Kyrenia landmarks
Kyrenia harbor is the most picturesque place in Kyrenia. Apart from this, it is a small harbor for fishing boats and small yachts. Also, the former buildings of trade and customs services were occupied by restaurants and small hotels.
Kyrenia fortress – founded in the 7th century by the Byzantines to protect against Arab pirates, rebuilt by the French in the 12th-13th centuries. And then the Venetians in the 15th century. The fortress is currently open to tourists. In general, one of the most amazing museums is located here – the shipwreck museum. The main pride of the museum is the ship’s hull of the 4th century BC, found in 1969 near the port, until recently – the oldest in the world (in 2018, an older ship was discovered off the coast of Greece). As a result, judging by the absence of traces of crew members and expensive goods on the ship, it was attacked by pirates, plundered and flooded.
Apartment in new modern building will pleasantly surprise you.

The ancient city of Salamis (Salamis) is one of the most important sights of Northern Cyprus. It is sometimes even said that the history of Salamis is the history of Cyprus. Ancient harmony frozen in marble literally mesmerizes tourists. You can wander around the ruins of Salamis for more than one day, and there is no doubt that they keep many secrets and treasures.
Let’s plunge into history
For many centuries Salamis played a leading role in the political. Economic and cultural life of ancient Cyprus. Most scientists are inclined to believe that during the Trojan War on the coast of the Gulf of Famagusta, a trading post of the Achaeans was founded. Around 1100 BC, a large-scale invasion of the Achaean Greeks began in Cyprus, who took the capital Alasia by storm. The inhabitants of the destroyed city moved to the trading settlement of the Achaeans on the shores of the bay. This was the beginning of the development of Salamis.
The mention of Salamis in historical documents appears only in the 7th century BC. At this time, the Assyrians invaded the island. The importance of Salamis in the political life of the island grew. In 538, King Eleuton II already minted his own coin – the first Cyprus coin known to scientists. The inscription on it is made in the language of the ethno-Cypriots, which has not yet been deciphered.

So, the characteristics of the apartment
Electric water heater
Wardrobe closet
Central Internet and Central Satellite Systems
Elevator
Video intercom and central camera
Washing machine
Refrigerator
Led TV
Single bed
Excellent location
Undoubtedly 5 minutes drive to the best beaches of the coast.
Of course, cafes and restaurants are within walking distance.
In addition, a shopping center, school, pharmacy, supermarket, cafes and restaurants within a radius of 1 km.
20 minutes drive from the best 5-star hotels on the island: Artemis, Noah’s Ark, Limak, Concor.
10 minutes drive to EMU.
30 minutes to Ercan airport.
35 minutes drive to Nicosia.
In addition, 45 minutes drive to the center of Nicosia.
Famagusta city. Northern Cyprus
Famagusta is “lucky” with its names. For example, the Greeks call this city Ammochostos (Αμμόχωστος), the Turks – Magosa or Gazimagusa. Therefore, on the signs, the city can be called completely differently, depending on which side of Cyprus you will drive up from, but not Famagusta.
Famagusta fortress
The old town is surrounded by a fortress wall. Of course, if you want to walk along the wall, then to get around it, you have to “wind” more than three kilometers. The height of the fortress walls reaches 15-17 meters, and the width is 5-9 meters. From above, the fortress looks like an irregular rectangle. Its walls have survived many earthquakes. And also, artillery shelling, but perfectly preserved.
The Lusignans were the first to build the fortifications of Famagusta. The Venetians significantly rebuilt the fortress – it was already necessary to take into account the artillery that had appeared by that time.
We leave the car and head towards a huge building, which is clearly visible from the parking lot. As a result, this is the main attraction of Famagusta – the Cathedral of St. Nicholas, and now the Lala Mustafa Pasha mosque.

Gonyeli is a city and municipality in the north of Cyprus, in the region of Levkosha. It is located near the capital of the republic — Nicosia. Undoubtedly, it is controlled by a partially recognized state — the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.
Since the Ottoman period, the city has been inhabited mainly by Turks. During the Cyprus crisis in 1963-1975, the city became as a reception center for Turkish refugees from the surrounding villages, oppressed by the Greeks.
And also, Gönyeli was the place of deployment of a part of the Turkish regiment, which was located on the island in accordance with the treaties of 1959-1960.
Also a football club
In addition, the football club Gönyeli Spor Kulübü is based in this city.
Every July, the city center hosts the Gonyeli International Folk Dance Festival. This festival lasts one week, with groups of dancers from countries such as Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey.
The city is popular with students, as it is located near the Middle East University in Nicosia, and many students rent accommodation in Gonyeli.
In general, the suburb is constantly growing. As a consequence, in 2020, the government of Northern Cyprus decided to start building a new bridge. This project should help solve the problems with empty traffic in Nicosia. The width of the bridge will make up 20 meters. There also the four lanes for cars, two sidewalks for pedestrians will be built.

Varosha Resort inNorthern Cyprus
Elite Varosha was closed for visits, surrounded by a barbed fence and a round-the-clock security was set up so that no one alive could enter its territory. For example, over time,  gray boxes only remained from buildings, restaurants and shops, the asphalt cracked, and the streets were overgrown with impassable bushes and grass. In general, the ghost of Famagusta excites the imagination of local people and guests of the island for more than a decade.
As a result, today Famagusta is a ghost town, with the world-famous Varosha quarter, which attracts thousands of tourists with its originality. Many people come here every year hoping to see Varosha. However, it is possible to do this only through obstacles or with the help of photographs. Therefore, tourists have only choice to enjoy all other places of interests of Famagusta. By the way, it brings not small income to the treasury of the city. Apartments with 2 bedrooms for investment with Veles Property.

It should be noted that the house consists of 44 apartments and has only 8 floors. Moreover, from the 1st to the 4th floor there are 6 apartments, from the 5th to the 8th floor there are 5 apartments with large terraces.
Features of the complex:

However, the maintenance of the complex is at an additional cost.
Among other things, Famagusta is currently, on the one hand, a popular tourist resort. Thanks to its sandy beaches and nature reserves.
On the other hand, it is a training center. In this connection, today more than 20,000 students from all over the world study there.
It is the large number of tourists in summer and students in winter. That make this complex extremely attractive for investment.
Famagusta history
For the first time, the city of Famagusta is mentioned in historical materials as Arsinoe in the 3rd century BC.
According to the chronicle, it was built by Ptolemy II during the reign of the Greek dynasty of the Ptolemies in Egypt and Cyprus.
The city grew slowly, and the local population actively mastered agriculture. Besides fishing and various crafts. So, practically for 15 centuries, it has become a leading trade and agricultural nucleus. A sea hub between the major cities of the island and the countries of the entire Mediterranean.
In 1190-1191, during a strong storm, the ships of the Crusaders, led by Richard the Lionheart, were wrecked off the coast of Famagusta.
The then ruler of Cyprus, Isaac Comnenus, instead of giving a helping hand, treated the victims very cruelly. Because of which he later paid a lot.
However, the answer was not long in coming. In 1192, Richard attacked the island. Captured Famagusta and Nicosia, took Comnenus prisoner, and declared himself the new ruler of Cyprus. However, not long after sitting on the throne, Richard the Lionheart sold the island to the Knights Templar. And those soon became the Lusignans, who turned the country into the Kingdom of Cyprus ..
An apartment as an investment is your passive income!

Briefly about the history of Famagusta
The city was founded by the king of Hellenistic Egypt Ptolemy II at the beginning of the 3rd century BC. a few kilometers from the most ancient city of Cyprus – Salamis. Ptolemy II received the nickname Philodelphus (Πτολεμαῖος Φιλάδελφος), which means “loving sister”, after he married his sister Arsinoe. In honor of her, the new city was named Arsinoe.
For a long time Arsinoe looked more like a small fishing village than a city. Only in the 7th century, after the destruction by the Arabs of neighboring Salamis, which at that time was already called Constantia, settlers began to arrive in it. Gradually, Arsinoe turned from a “village” into a small port city, which was named Ammochostos, which translated from Greek means “lost in the sands”. The Greeks themselves still call it that.
History
The key moment for the city was 1192, when Cyprus passed into the hands of the Lusignan, who continued the renaming, calling the city Famagusta. It was with the arrival of the Lusignans that the city began to develop rapidly. And soon it becomes a full-fledged city. Famagusta is starting to play an increasing role in the Eastern Mediterranean. And the most rapid development of Famagusta began in 1291 – after the fall of Tire and Acre and the departure of the crusaders from the Holy Land, Christian settlers from Palestine poured into the city. Subsequently, Famagusta passed into the hands of the Genoese, and then the Venetians. Remaining the only major port between Europe and Asia, Famagusta flourished thanks to active trade.
Merchants and shipowners of that time were drowning in luxury, but they did not forget about the city either. It was believed that the wealth of the city can be estimated by the number of churches in it. So, according to this indicator, Famagusta was one of the leaders. “City of 365 churches” – so they once spoke of her.

Kyrenia is an ancient city in the north of the island, part of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, but nevertheless attracts tourists with both its numerous beaches and historical sights, which are also abundant here.
This area has several beaches suitable for a holiday resort. And also where you can practice water sports or sit in one of the coastal taverns. For example, Kervansaray Beach is one of the most famous and popular sandy beaches, where all the necessary infrastructure has been created for a great holiday on the seashore. Acapulco Beach can only be reached through a military camp, but this is not such an obstacle, given that the beach is quite popular.
Here are good opportunities to do windsurfing. Alagadi Beach is located about 15 kilometers from the city in a picturesque double bay, but this beach is not equipped that much, therefore, it is usually not so crowded, and you can bring anything you want or wish with you, and it’s acceptable.

Salamis
The ancient city of Salamis (Salamis) is one of the most important sights of Northern Cyprus.. It is sometimes even said that the history of Salamis is the history of Cyprus. Ancient harmony frozen in marble literally mesmerizes tourists. You can wander around the ruins of Salamis for more than one day. And there is no doubt that they keep many secrets and treasures.
For many centuries Salamis played a leading role in the political, economic and cultural life of ancient Cyprus. Most scholars are inclined to believe that during the Trojan War on the coast of the Gulf of Famagusta. A trading post of the Achaean Greeks was founded. Around 1100 BC, a large-scale invasion of the Achaean Greeks began in Cyprus, who took the capital Alasia by storm. The inhabitants of the destroyed city moved to the trading settlement of the Achaeans on the shores of the bay. This was the beginning of the development of Salamis.
The mention of Salamis in historical documents appears only in the 7th century BC. At this time, the Assyrians invaded the island. The importance of Salamis in the political life of the island grew. In 538, King Eleuton II already minted his own coin – the first Cyprus coin known to scientists. The inscription on it is made in the language of the ethno-Cypriots, which has not yet been deciphered.

Richard the Lionheart, Kings of Cyprus and the Jealous Commandant
On May 1, 1191, the fleet of the English Crusader King Richard the Lionheart, heading from Rhodes to Accra, was caught in a storm. Of the four ships washed ashore, one survived, but its passengers – the king’s sister and bride – became prisoners of the usurper of Cyprus Isaac Comnenus.
Of course, Richard’s answer was symmetrical: he took over the island. Undoubtedly, having waited for the emperor to leave him for a while. After that, for many years, until the end of the XIII century, Cyprus remained in the possession of the Crusaders.
In addition, during the Turkish rule, the Cathedral of St. Nicholas was renamed the Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque.
Famagusta became a significant settlement in Cyprus only at the end of the 13th century, with the fall of the Christian kingdoms of Palestine.
Moreover, it was thanks to the exodus of the Crusaders that Famagusta soon became a city where those who still dreamed of returning to the Holy Land settled.
Hopes were in vain, but Famagusta turned into a rich trading port, protected by a formidable fortress.
From 1328 to 1374 representatives of the Lusignan dynasty, nominally considered the kings of Jerusalem, and in fact – the kings of Cyprus – were crowned in the Cathedral of St. Nicholas in Famagusta.
It was so interesting …
In 1374, Famagusta was annexed by Genoa, which won the war with Cyprus. The Lusignan dynasty died out in 1489. After which, according to the will of the widow of the last king, Catherine Cornaro, Cyprus passed to Venice.
Rumor has it that the story of a jealous husband and his wife. This happened here in 1508. Formed the basis of Shakespeare’s tragedy “Othello”
In 1505, Cristoforo Moro was appointed commandant of the fortress and castle of Famagusta. Which also became Venetian. The fortress has already been renovated. And the castle has been rebuilt in the Renaissance style.
In addition, according to legend, from one of its towers in 1508, the commandant Moreau threw the body of his murdered wife. Suspected by him of infidelity, and then committed suicide. This dark story formed the basis of Shakespeare’s tragedy “Othello”.

Northern Cyprus
Throughout its history, the island has had such names as Alashia, Kitty, Yadnana, Hittami. However, the most common theory is that the name of the island comes from the word “Cuprumm, Cyprium”, which means copper, which prevails on the island.
With olive, carob, cypress and pine trees and green vegetation, Northern Cyprus is beautiful at any time of the year. The vegetation of Northern Cyprus, which has fertile soil, appears before us in different colors at every season. Citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, tangerines, and grapefruits are grown on the island. Also, watermelons, potatoes and other vegetables and fruits. The coastal strip is covered with eucalyptus and acacias. While in the mountainous areas, fragrant conifers grow.
Northern Cyprus has a healthy Mediterranean climate. Summers are long and hot. On the other hand, winter is short. Moreover, such concepts as cold wind, cold and snow are not familiar to Northern Cyprus. Precipitation falls mainly in the form of rain. However, very rarely in the mountainous area, in the vicinity of the city of Kyrenia, snow falls, which immediately melts.

Varosha Resort inNorthern Cyprus,
Elite Varosha was closed for visits, surrounded by a barbed fence and a round-the-clock security was set up so that no one alive could enter its territory. For example, over time,  gray boxes only remained from buildings, restaurants and shops, the asphalt cracked, and the streets were overgrown with impassable bushes and grass. In general, the ghost of Famagusta excites the imagination of local people and guests of the island for more than a decade.
As a result, today Famagusta is a ghost town, with the world-famous Varosha quarter, which attracts thousands of tourists with its originality. Many people come here every year hoping to see Varosha. However, it is possible to do this only through obstacles or with the help of photographs. Therefore, tourists have only choice to enjoy all other places of interests of Famagusta. By the way, it brings not small income to the treasury of the city. Apartments with 2 bedrooms for investment with Veles Property.

The fortress is currently open to tourists. In general, one of the most amazing museums is located here – the shipwreck museum. The main pride of the museum is the ship’s hull of the 4th century BC, found in 1969 near the port, until recently – the oldest in the world (in 2018, an older ship was discovered off the coast of Greece). As a result, judging by the absence of traces of crew members and expensive goods on the ship, it was attacked by pirates, plundered and flooded.
Apartment 2 + 1 in the center of Girne will pleasantly surprise you.

Tuzla
The settlement of Engomi (Enkomi) or Tuzla, even older than Salamis and arose in 1850-1650 BC, at a time when Cypriots learned to smelt bronze. In addition, rich copper deposits were found on the island. In general, the island began to trade with other Mediterranean countries. One of the copper deposits, for example, was located near Engomi. The area was also home to Cypriot cedar, which was exported abroad. As a result, at the end of the XIV century, Engomi was surrounded by a powerful wall, and a necropolis was built nearby. Archaeologists have discovered many intact tombs with jewelry, weapons, copper, silver and gold products. Some of these items were covered in Egyptian hieroglyphs.

Northern Cyprus
Throughout its history, the island has had such names as Alashia, Kitty, Yadnana, Hittami. However, the most common theory is that the name of the island comes from the word “Cuprumm, Cyprium”, which means copper, which prevails on the island.
With olive, carob, cypress and pine trees and green vegetation, Northern Cyprus is beautiful at any time of the year. The vegetation of Northern
Cyprus, which has fertile soil, appears before us in different colors at every season. Citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, tangerines, and grapefruits are grown on the island. Also, watermelons, potatoes and other vegetables and fruits. The coastal strip is covered with eucalyptus and acacias. While in the mountainous areas, fragrant conifers grow.
Northern Cyprus has a healthy Mediterranean climate. Summers are long and hot. On the other hand, winter is short. Moreover, such concepts as cold wind, cold and snow are not familiar to Northern Cyprus. Precipitation falls mainly in the form of rain. However, very rarely in the mountainous area, in the vicinity of the city of Kyrenia, snow falls, which immediately melts.
New apartment-duplex 2 + 1 from the developer together with Veles Property.

Northern Cyprus
Throughout its history, the island has had such names as Alashia, Kitty, Yadnana, Hittami. However, the most common theory is that the name of the island comes from the word “Cuprumm, Cyprium”, which means copper, which prevails on the island.
With olive, carob, cypress and pine trees and green vegetation, Northern Cyprus is beautiful at any time of the year. The vegetation of Northern Cyprus, which has fertile soil, appears before us in different colors at every season. Citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, tangerines, and grapefruits are grown on the island. Also, watermelons, potatoes and other vegetables and fruits. The coastal strip is covered with eucalyptus and acacias. While in the mountainous areas, fragrant conifers grow.
Northern Cyprus has a healthy Mediterranean climate. Summers are long and hot. On the other hand, winter is short. Moreover, such concepts as cold wind, cold and snow are not familiar to Northern Cyprus. Precipitation falls mainly in the form of rain. However, very rarely in the mountainous area, in the vicinity of the city of Kyrenia, snow falls, which immediately melts.

From empires to republic
The Famagusta fortress in Cyprus is famous not only for the Othello tower, but also for the heroic defense in 1570-71, during the siege of the city by the troops of the Turkish Sultan Selim II.
The siege lasted 10 months, but the forces were clearly unequal and the Venetians had to surrender the city.
One of the conditions for surrender was the unhindered exit of the surviving soldiers from Famagusta. Lala Mustafa Pasha, the commander of the Turkish army that was besieging the fortress, agreed to these conditions, but did not keep his promise.
It is worth noting that until recently Famagusta was one of the most fashionable resorts in the Mediterranean.
Turkey owned Cyprus until 1878. In Famagusta, the southern coastal region of Varosha was assigned to the Greeks. Unfortunately, Orthodox and Latin churches have become mosques.
The Cathedral of St. Nicholas (now the Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque) also became a mosque, but most Greek Cypriots continued to secretly practice Christian rites.
From 1878 to 1960 Cyprus was a British colony, but the Turks and Greeks still lived separately.
Cyprus gained independence in 1960, while both communities retained full self-government.
This made it possible to start developing the tourism business. Famagusta in Northern Cyprus, has become one of the most prestigious resorts. Among her guests were Brigitte Bardot and Elizabeth Taylor with Richard Burton.
In the Varosha district, a full-scale construction of hotels was launched on the first line, and on the second – next to colonial-style houses – new villas appeared …

Description

Stylish villa for sale in Karsiyaka from the developer just 300 meters from the sea. The first thing that distinguishes it from all others is an unusual modern design with rounded shapes. From the street the villa itself looks small. But inside it is a fairly spacious house with three bedrooms and three bathrooms. There is also a spacious living room combined with a kitchen, in addition, there are small terraces, balconies and parking for cars.
The master bedroom has a dressing room and a unique bathroom with a transparent shower wall for 2 people.
In total, there were 15 such villas. But half of them were already sold out before they were completed. Therefore, you need to hurry.

In walking distance there is a lagoon with a beach. Although it is not equipped, it is quiet and not crowded.

According to legend, the city was founded by the legendary Kefey (Cepheus) – one of the Argonauts, the husband of Cassiopeia and the father of Andromeda, after whom the constellation is named. The first written mention goes back to Ramses III – Kyrenia is listed as one of the city-states of Cyprus.
The most powerful city on the island was Salamis. Kyrenia, along with the neighboring city of Lambusa (Lapetos), has become a major center of trade with Asia Minor and Greece. The era of the Roman Empire and after its division, in the Byzantine period (from 395), was the heyday of Kyrenia: a large trading port and a Kyrenian fortress were built. It is to this era that the famous Kyrenian ship sunk near the coast belongs.

Kyrenia
Kyrenia or Girne (tour. Girne) is a city in Cyprus. After the Turkish aggression in 1974, it is located on the territory of the unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. It is now considered the tourist center of Northern Cyprus.. Located on the northern coast of the island, at the foot of the Kyrenia Mountains. In addition, there are two versions of the origin of the name of the city: by the name of Aphrodite – “Cyreniana”, or from the name of one of the Greek mountains.
Kyrenia landmarks
Kyrenia harbor is the most picturesque place in Kyrenia. Apart from this, it is a small harbor for fishing boats and small yachts. Also, the former buildings of trade and customs services were occupied by restaurants and small hotels.
Kyrenia fortress – founded in the 7th century by the Byzantines to protect against Arab pirates, rebuilt by the French in the 12th-13th centuries. And then the Venetians in the 15th century. The fortress is currently open to tourists. In general, one of the most amazing museums is located here – the shipwreck museum. The main pride of the museum is the ship’s hull of the 4th century BC, found in 1969 near the port, until recently – the oldest in the world (in 2018, an older ship was discovered off the coast of Greece). As a result, judging by the absence of traces of crew members and expensive goods on the ship, it was attacked by pirates, plundered and flooded.
Penthouse 2 + 1 in the center of Girne will pleasantly surprise you.

Description

Orange Villa in Karsiyaka is both lovely and beautiful. And we sell it exclusively for you!
A rustic villa with a pool and a gazebo by the fountain, and a gorgeous garden. Modified and definitely improved for a comfortable stay. Heating is installed and all the terraces are covered with roofs. In addition, the rear terrace is glazed, thus forming an additional room. Living in the house, for example, in the summer is comfortable and without air conditioning. And in winter, in addition to heating, there is a wood-burning fireplace. What better way to sit by the crackling hearth on chilly Cyprus evenings.
You will see all the beauty in the photo and video. I recommend and take a walk with the Virtual Tour.
Inner space
Upon entering, it enters the corridor leading to the bedrooms and from the other side of the living room, and the stairs to the second floor. The living room is spacious, with a fireplace and is combined with the kitchen, from which you can also get to the glazed terrace. Each bedroom has small fitted wardrobes. On the first floor there are two bedrooms and a shared bathroom. Also a living room with a kitchenette and a room resulting from a terrace.
The stairs lead to the master bedroom on the second floor, which has its own bathroom. Also from the bedroom there is an exit to a large spacious roofed terrace. This terrace overlooks the entire pool and barbecue area. In the corner of the site there is a pond-waterfall, with its murmur relaxing people having a rest in a gazebo.
The entire area is landscaped with various exotic plants and fruit trees. In the garden near the fence, away from the house, there are tanks for water and gas. There is a large parking lot, if you wish, you can put 2 cars.
The only drawback of the house is the lack of title to land. But not everyone wants to arrange it, so for many it is not a problem. The house is beautiful, the territory is large, fully equipped for a comfortable stay.
Orange Villa in Karsiyaka is certainly available for remote purchase. It can be viewed online.

The island of Cyprus is one of the most mysterious places on earth. The mysterious nature of Northern Cyprus breathes a Mediterranean aroma! Moreover, Northern Cyprus is the most mysterious representative of history. Here are some of the most magnificent monuments of Gothic art in the Eastern Mediterranean!
Richard the Lionheart, Kings of Cyprus and the Jealous Commandant
On May 1, 1191, the fleet of the English Crusader King Richard the Lionheart, heading from Rhodes to Accra, was caught in a storm. Of the four ships washed ashore, one survived. But its passengers – the king’s sister and bride – became prisoners of the usurper of Cyprus Isaac Comnenus. Of course, Richard’s answer was symmetrical: he took over the island. Undoubtedly, having waited for the emperor to leave him for a while. After that, for many years, until the end of the XIII century, Cyprus remained in the possession of the Crusaders. In addition, during the Turkish rule, the Cathedral of St. Nicholas was renamed the Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque.
Famagusta became a significant settlement in Cyprus only at the end of the 13th century, with the fall of the Christian kingdoms of Palestine. Moreover, it was thanks to the exodus of the Crusaders that Famagusta soon became a city where those who still dreamed of returning to the Holy Land settled. Hopes were in vain, but Famagusta turned into a rich trading port, protected by a formidable fortress. From 1328 to 1374 representatives of the Lusignan dynasty, nominally considered the kings of Jerusalem. In fact, they were crowned kings of Cyprus in the Cathedral of St. Nicholas in Famagusta.
More about history
In 1374, Famagusta was annexed by Genoa, which won the war with Cyprus. The Lusignan dynasty died out in 1489, after which, according to the will of the widow of the last king, Catherine Cornaro, Cyprus passed to Venice. Rumor has it that the story of a jealous husband and his wife, which happened here in 1508, formed the basis of Shakespeare’s tragedy “Othello” In 1505, Cristoforo Moro was appointed commandant of the fortress and castle of Famagusta, which also became Venetian. The fortress has already been renovated, and the castle has been rebuilt in the Renaissance style.
In addition, according to legend, from one of its towers in 1508, the commandant Moreau threw the body of his murdered wife, suspected by him of infidelity, and then committed suicide. This dark story formed the basis of Shakespeare’s tragedy “Othello”.

Description

Luxury apartments in an elite complex, next to the golf club. Not far from the sea, and from the sandy turtle beaches, 20 minutes from the city. This is exactly what you and your family need.
The complex itself has everything you need for life, several swimming pools, a restaurant, a luxurious garden. At the same time, sports and tennis courts. And such a gorgeous garden, you will not find anywhere else in Cyprus. It’s also great to walk along it in the evening. Or sit by the pool to read a book or sunbathe in the gentle sun of Northern Cyprus.
The apartment is very spacious and looks more like a big house than an apartment. From the hallway we find ourselves in a large hall, combined with a kitchen. But at the same time, a separate bar counter. Take a look at the photo, watch the video and take a walk with our virtual tour to experience all the luxury of the interior and exterior. Along the corridor we find ourselves in three bedrooms, one of which is the master’s bedroom with its own toilet. There is also a shared bathroom with a shower. We are waiting for you to lie on soft and cozy sofas in front of the TV, so that you say for sure – “YES, this is the house where I want to live”
Important point
The location of the complex itself is also of great importance when choosing a property. The complex is located not only between the mountains and the sea. But also between Kyrenia and Esentepe, which makes it a kind of middle point for access to the entire civilization. While being in the midst of the most beautiful nature and green forests of Northern Cyprus.
If you have not enough reasons and what you saw, we are waiting for you on a familiarization tour. And for this you just have to contact us by filling in the lines on the side. You can start and not think.
And remember, these luxury apartments in an elite complex can be viewed online. Of course, this apartment is available for remote purchase.
When buying this apartment, VELES Property provides assistance not only in obtaining a residence permit, but also a bank account, driver’s license and health insurance in North Cyprus!

Social ceremonies such as weddings, circumcisions, and celebrations are very important. As a consequence, the family tradition is to get together and take part in various activities. The feeling of social solidarity is very high. A characteristic feature of the Turkish Cypriot community is the traditional Turkish hospitality known throughout the world. The oldest of the guests is the most respected person and is welcomed in a way that is appreciated by the whole community. The culture of coffee making is very developed. Even if you find yourself in an unfamiliar environment, you will be served coffee. As a result, the culture of food and hospitality is the most distinctive feature of everyday life in North Cyprus.
Grace for your soul
In season, “ice sherbet”, carefully prepared from citrus fruits and lemonade such as lemons and tangerines, is served to guests on the balcony, porch or in the garden of the house in summer. Jams are also served to guests. The presentation of beautiful and delicious jams prepared in a special way requires a special ceremony. Walnut jam is the most valuable delicacy. Served in a small bowl with small forks and a glass of water.

Also fortifications were built, but they did not protect the territory from the Ottoman Turks, who attacked Cyprus in the 71st year of the sixteenth century. The fortification was taken. As a result, all local residents were evicted to the surrounding lands. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the territory of Kyrenia was ruled by the British.

Since then and until now, tourism has become the main profit.

Kyrenia
Kyrenia or Girne (tour. Girne) is a city in Cyprus. Nevertheless, after the Turkish aggression in 1974, it is located on the territory of the unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. It is now considered the tourist center of Northern Cyprus. Located on the north coast of the island. Moreover, at the foot of the Kyrenia Mountains.
The settlement on the site of modern Kyrenia dates back to the 10th century BC, although the most ancient archaeological finds date back to 5800 BC. According to legend, the city was founded by the legendary Kefey (Cepheus) – one of the Argonauts, the husband of Cassiopeia and the father of Andromeda, after whom the constellation is named. The first written mention goes back to Ramses III – Kyrenia is listed as one of the city-states of Cyprus.
The most powerful city on the island was Salamis. Kyrenia, along with the neighboring city of Lambusa (Lapetos), has become a major center of trade with Asia Minor and Greece. The era of the Roman Empire and after its division, in the Byzantine period (from 395), was the heyday of Kyrenia: a large trading port and a Kyrenian fortress were built. It is to this era that the famous Kyrenian ship sunk near the coast belongs.

Description

Your dream home in North Cyprus! Each person should have a place where he wants to return all the time! We present to your attention a cozy villa for permanent residence with the whole family! It will be comfortable for everyone: both adults and children, and even your beloved pets! The house is located in a quiet city and at the same time is located in the center of Kyrenia. In addition, the international university GAU is located on the next street.
Description
Let’s take a closer look at this wonderful home! There is a high fence around the territory. Thus, your privacy will be hidden from prying eyes. The entire territory of the house is under video surveillance. And you can remotely monitor the house. The yard is fully landscaped. There is an artificial lawn in front of the front entrance; trees with various exotic fruits are planted around the perimeter. Lemons, oranges, plums, papaya, passionfruit, avocado, almond, peach and many other fruit trees. Also in the yard there is a spacious area for two parking spaces with a powerful canopy made of metal structures. All this is covered with wood. This design will hide the cars from direct sunlight. Moreover, there is a well in the yard!
Individual characteristics
There are 2 water tanks in the backyard, one of them is attached to the well! Each tank is 5 tons (they are hidden underground). There is a spacious shed for household purposes. Plus a two-line irrigation system! There are solar panels on the roof. The terrace on the ground floor is completely closed and glazed. There the hostess equipped a bright and beautiful office. The house has a thermostat and a new boiler (respectively, batteries are removed in each room). This house is fully insulated, both walls and floors. The floor is covered with laminate.
Any hostess will appreciate the beautiful built-in kitchen with pull-out wardrobes and modern built-in appliances. And also there is a separate laundry room, of course cleverly hidden from prying eyes. The walls in the living room are painted by the artist. It will seem to you that you are in a garden. In the bedrooms there are Roman curtains with a warming effect!
Due to the fact that the terrace was closed, we can assume that in total there is a house with 5 rooms. On the second floor, you can also glaze the terrace and get another room!
The Cité has a communal swimming pool

Karpas. Northern Cyprus
The Karpas Peninsula (Karpasia) is a narrow, long segment of land that is now so popular with tourists and locals. Of course, a truly amazing atmosphere reigns here. As a result, among the pristine nature, you can relax and gain strength.
Karpas beckons with kilometers of sandy beaches, plains covered with emerald greenery. Not only that, green spaces consisting of olive trees. Farmers have lived here for centuries in small cozy villages, working on the generous black soil.
Features of Karpas
The area is not particularly burdened with transport interchanges or rich well-thought-out infrastructure. But here is the richest flora and fauna. The Golden Sands beach is recognized as one of the best and most environmentally friendly in the world.
Tourists are burnt by six kilometers of sand dunes with a perfectly clean coastline. The beach was chosen not only by connoisseurs of cleanliness and virgin nature, but also by the Loggerhead sea turtles. They love to lay their eggs here.
Special sights
They say about the peninsula that time has stopped here. Undoubtedly, looking at some of the sights, you might really think so. In summer, locals leave for ceremonies to take a break from everyday life and hustle and bustle.
The most extreme point of the eastern part of Karpas became the location of the monastery of the Apostle Andrew. At all times, travelers came to the island for peace and solitude, and a nearby source with healing water also made people healthy.

Kyrenia
Kyrenia or Girne (tour. Girne) is a city in Cyprus. Nevertheless, after the Turkish aggression in 1974, it is located on the territory of the unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. It is now considered the tourist center of Northern Cyprus. Located on the north coast of the island. Moreover, at the foot of the Kyrenia Mountains.
The settlement on the site of modern Kyrenia arose in the 10th century BC, although the most ancient archaeological finds date back to 5800 BC. According to legend, the city was founded by the legendary Kefey (Cepheus) – one of the Argonauts, the husband of Cassiopeia and the father of Andromeda, after whom the constellation is named. The first written mention goes back to Ramses III – Kyrenia is listed as one of the city-states of Cyprus.
The most powerful city on the island was Salamis. Kyrenia, along with the neighboring city of Lambusa (Lapetos), has become a major center of trade with Asia Minor and Greece. The era of the Roman Empire and after its division, in the Byzantine period (from 395), was the heyday of Kyrenia: a large trading port and a Kyrenian fortress were built. It is to this era that the famous Kyrenian ship sunk near the coast belongs.

When entering the house, water goes through a coarse cleaning and softening system. Thanks to this, the plumbing does not fail and does not have a deposit. At the same time, there is a fine cleaning system after which you can drink crystal clear water.
Electricity
First of all, 380 volts (3 phases) are brought into the house. For what? Certainly for 10 Kwt solar panels, which generate and send excess electricity to the grid. Thus, accumulating a large supply of electricity for the winter. Due to this, inventory air conditioners operate in the house almost all year round 24/7. Of course, maintaining a constant comfortable temperature. Moreover, in the winter months, a heat pump is switched on (the most efficient heating system). Moreover, he is catching up
emits hot water into the accumulator, provides the house with constantly hot water and warm batteries. Literally all winter, the house is warm and comfortable. But most importantly, using all this, the electricity bills are certainly scanty, less than in a one-room apartment.
Window
The windows are sliding, but not standard inherent in Cypriot apartments. And energy saving, tightly closing with ventilation system.
The guest room on the ground floor has a floor heating system. Throughout the house, fitted wardrobes in every room and hallway. There is a technical room where the equipment for the house is located and it also serves as a workshop. There is a mini gym and a steam room with a “Fitobochka” equipped. Also with a steam generator system with the ability to use herbs for the health of your body.
All bedrooms have parquet and laminate flooring. All interior doors are solid wood. The kitchen is made to order, the most convenient for use. Separate laundry room. Each bedroom has a bathroom. Each floor has spacious terraces with a total area of ​​100 square meters. From where the most gorgeous views of the mountains and the sea open. Most of the furniture will undoubtedly remain with the new owners. The current owners will take with them only the most valuable for them.
The garden around the house deserves special attention. This house is literally buried in greenery, with an evergreen liana wrapping around every wall. Tall trees hide the house from all sides from prying eyes and the scorching sun. Fruit trees, grapes, cactus alley, palms. These are not all plants that can be enjoyed walking in the garden.
Excellent location
The villa itself is located in Alsancak, on the hills of Edermit. Thanks to this, it has gorgeous views of the sea and mountains. At the same time, it is 5 minutes to the nearest beach.

Bellapais
Bellapais is a small village located six kilometers from Kerinia at the foot of the Kerinian ridge. The jewel of the village is Bellapais Abbey, one of the finest examples of Gothic art in Cyprus. If you are already going to visit Northern Cyprus in the Kerinia region, then we definitely advise you to look here too.
It is worth noting that the modern name of the monastery comes from the French Abbaye de la Paix, which means the Abbey of Peace. In addition, the monastery received another name – White Abbey – because of the color of the clothes worn by the local monks.
